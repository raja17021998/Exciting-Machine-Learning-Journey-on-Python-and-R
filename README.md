# Exciting-Machine-Learning-Journey-on-Python-and-R<br>
This repository contains certain Machine Learning modules built on Python and R well organised into sections and sub-sections
I have worked on several datasets as provided by my instructor implementing the following algorithms in Python and R:<br>


  REGRESSION:<br>
    Simple Linear Regression<br>
    Multiple Linear Regression<br>
    Polynomial Linear Regression<br>
    Support Vector Regression<br>
    Decision Tree Regression<br>
    Random Forest Regression<br><br>
  CLASSIFICATION:<br>
    Logistic Regression<br>
    K Nearest Neighbours(KNN)<br>
    Support Vector Machines(SVMs)<br>
    Kernel Support Vector Machines(K-SVMs)<br>
    Naive Bayes<br>
    Decision Tree Classification<br>
    Random Forest Classification<br><br>
  CLUSTERING:<br>
    K-Means Clustering<br>
    Heirarchical Clustering<br><br>
   ASSOCIATION RULE LEARNING:<br>
    Apriori<br>
    Eclat*<br><br>
  REINFORCEMENT LEARNING^:<br>
    Upper Confidence Bound(UCB)<br>
    Thompson Sampling<br><br>
  NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING<br><br>
  DEEP LEARNING":<br>
    Artificial Neural Networks(ANNs)<br>
    Convolutional Neural Networks(CNNs)**<br><br>
  DIMENSIONALITY REDUCTION:<br>
    Principal Component Analysis(PCA)<br>
    Linear Discriminant Analysis(LDA)<br>
    Kernel Principal Component Analysis(K-PCA)<br><br>
   XGBOOST<br><br>
   
   And finally some Model Selection Techniques like:<br>
    k-fold Cross Validation<br>
    Grid Search<br>
    <br>
   * ECLAT was only build on R<br>
   ^ This section as an exception to all others was built from scratch without using any libraries in both Python and R<br>
   ** CNN was built only on Python because R's H2O's package Deep Water was under devolopment as of now<br>
   "  For building Deep Learning Modules following libraries and packages were used:<br>
       (.) PYTHON: Keras Library on TENSORFLOW backend<br>
       (.) R     : H2O Library<br><br><br>
       
 There are two copies one orignal and one with _wd endings, just due to Windows 8.1 and Linux dual boot working environments
