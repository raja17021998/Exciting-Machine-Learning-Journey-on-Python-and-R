# Exciting-Machine-Learning-Journey-on-Python-and-R
This repository contains certain Machine Learning modules built on Python and R well organised into sections and sub-sections
I have worked on several datasets as provided by my instructor implementing the following algorithms in Python and R:
  REGRESSION:
    Simple Linear Regression
    Multiple Linear Regression
    Polynomial Linear Regression
    Support Vector Regression
    Decision Tree Regression
    Random Forest Regression
  CLASSIFICATION:
    Logistic Regression
    K Nearest Neighbours(KNN)
    Support Vector Machines(SVMs)
    Kernel Support Vector Machines(K-SVMs)
    Naive Bayes
    Decision Tree Classification
    Random Forest Classification
  CLUSTERING:
    K-Means Clustering
    Heirarchical Clustering
   ASSOCIATION RULE LEARNING:
    Apriori
    Eclat*
  REINFORCEMENT LEARNING^:
    Upper Confidence Bound(UCB)
    Thompson Sampling
  NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING
  DEEP LEARNING":
    Artificial Neural Networks(ANNs)
    Convolutional Neural Networks(CNNs)**
  DIMENSIONALITY REDUCTION:
    Principal Component Analysis(PCA)
    Linear Discriminant Analysis(LDA)
    Kernel Principal Component Analysis(K-PCA)
   XGBOOST
   
   And finally some Model Selection Techniques like:
    k-fold Cross Validation
    Grid Search
    
   *  : ECLAT was only build on R
   ^  : This section as an exception to all others was built from scratch without using any libraries in both Python and R
   ** : CNN was built only on Python because R's H2O's package Deep Water was under devolopment as of now
   "  : For building Deep Learning Modules following libraries and packages were used:
         (.) PYTHON: Keras Library on TENSORFLOW backend
         (.)R     : H2O Library
